- Document filter categories and their specific purposes
- Provide maintenance guidelines and contribution procedures
- Use markdown formatting consistently

### Markdown Compliance Requirements

- **ALL markdown files (.md) MUST pass markdownlint validation with zero errors or warnings**
- Run `markdownlint <filename>` on every markdown file before considering it complete

## Development Guidelines

### When Making Changes

- Preserve existing functionality unless explicitly asked to change it

- Test filters across supported ad blockers and browsers
- **Always run markdownlint and fix all issues in markdown files before considering changes complete**

### Annoyance Filter Standards
